#USING LAPTOPS TO EXTEND ACCESS POINTS FUNCTIONALITY:
############################################

Remember in the attached devices (laptops or other networks devices):

Redirect all traffic throught the access points:

One computer with IP 192.168.1.50 (called "50") and another with IP 192.168.1.51 (called "51"). Ten access Points has the IP range 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.10 (called "1" to "10").

Computer 50 is connected to the access point 1 and computer 51 with the access point 10.

	In Computer 50 must to be ONLY these routing table: (route -n)
	Destination	Gateway		Genmask 		...
	192.168.1.51	192.168.1.1	0.0.0.0		
	192.168.1.0	0.0.0.0		255.255.255.0
	0.0.0.0		192.168.1.1	0.0.0.0
	
		
	In Computer 51 must to be ONLY these routing table: (route -n)
	Destination	Gateway		Genmask 		...
	192.168.1.50	192.168.1.1	0.0.0.0		
	192.168.1.0	0.0.0.0		255.255.255.0
	0.0.0.0		192.168.1.1	0.0.0.0
		
	In Access Points 1 to 10:
	Nothing, Castadiva will do it for you!
	
With this, you can connect any webcam or other device and use in Castadiva.



# USING LAPTOPS LIKE ACCESS POINTS:
#############################

Add two laptops with webcams.

Review the Ethernet and Wifi network cards:
	- Right IPs.
	- Connect the WiFi Card to Castadiva.
	
Connect both laptops to the Castadiva NFS folder.

Start Ekiga in both machines.
	- Review that Ekiga listen to the wifi card.

Start the OLSR 4.10 routing protocol. (4.10 is the same version that is used in OpenWRT).

Define in Castadiva the laptops like another access point.

You don not need to define External Traffic with this configuration. Only start Ekiga. 
	
Warning!: Some PCMCIA WiFi cards goes out of the wifi network if there is a lot of traffic and clients. If you are experimenting problems with the traffic review the cell/BSSID of the network on each laptop.
